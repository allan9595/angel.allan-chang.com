My name is Angel. I am an beautiful Australia Shepherd! Ahh, You guys gonna love me!  I love run, sleep, eat and chase squirrels! Yes, I really hate them haha! I spend half of my day to sleep because I just love to sleep on Allan’s bed. He is so nice to me. I love that boy so much!

On January 16th, 2018, I have a new home and new best friend Allan. He rescued me from Denton Animal Shelter. Now, it has been three months to live with my best best friend Allan and I feel the love and compassion he has to me. Most important, he has so much patience on me when I blow out his trash can sometimes haha! He always forgives! Also, He took me to hang out with his overflow friends and teach me about God.

This is little about me, but I, Angel, will write more about my story and life in the future. I love Y’all ! Woof Woof!
